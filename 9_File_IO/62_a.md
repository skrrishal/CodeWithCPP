The exact performance can vary based on the specific use case, implementation, and optimization techniques used:

Assembly Language: Directly corresponds to machine code instructions, so itâ€™s extremely fast.
C: Known for its performance and efficiency, often used in systems programming.
C++: Extends C with object-oriented features, usually close in performance to C.
Rust: Modern systems programming language designed for performance and safety.
Go: Designed for concurrent programming and performance, often used for backend services.
Java: Compiled to bytecode and executed on the JVM, which optimizes at runtime.
C#: Similar to Java in performance, running on the .NET runtime.
Swift: Designed by Apple for performance and safety in iOS/macOS applications.
Kotlin: Runs on the JVM like Java, with similar performance.
TypeScript/JavaScript (Node.js): Fast for non-blocking I/O tasks but slower in CPU-bound tasks.
Python (with PyPy): JIT-compiled version of Python that offers performance improvements over CPython.
Ruby: Known for ease of use rather than performance.
PHP: Designed for web development, usually interpreted.
Perl: Similar to PHP in use cases and performance.
Python (CPython): The standard implementation, known for ease of use but slower performance.
R: Often used for statistical computing, can be slow without optimization.
MATLAB: Optimized for numerical computing but can be slower for general-purpose tasks.
Lua: Lightweight scripting language, relatively fast for its category.
Julia: High-level language designed for high-performance numerical analysis.
Haskell: Functional programming language, performance varies greatly with optimization.
